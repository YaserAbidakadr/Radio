  Radio
In this app: I have added multiple things:
  1. info card (2D object) over each receiver or transmitter that show the index and name of every thing you add.
  2. added around 300 lines of codes that calculates the strength of the wifi signal at each receiver using Friis equation.
  3.added a grid and html color to the text that would show in the snackbar.For example, If the signal is very strong, the text color will      be in green, not too much strong in yellow and weak signals in red.
